Whats up repository viewer? My name is Mitch. I'm trying out this whole computer science thing and I love it!
Git is pretty cool. I still don't understand it all the way but we'll get there.

I'll leave you with a fun fact: 
Torvalds sarcastically quipped about the name git (which means "unpleasant person" in British English slang): "I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First 'Linux', now 'git'." The man page describes Git as "the stupid content tracker".
